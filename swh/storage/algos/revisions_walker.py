    Abstract base class encapsulating the logic to walk across
    a revisions history starting from a given one.

    It defines an iterator returning the revisions according
    to a specific ordering implemented in derived classes.

    The iteration step performs the following operations:

        1) Check if the iteration is finished by calling method
           :meth:`is_finished` and raises :exc:`StopIteration` if it
           it is the case

        2) Get the next unseen revision by calling method
           :meth:`get_next_rev_id`

        3) Process parents of that revision by calling method
           :meth:`process_parent_revs` for the next iteration
           steps

        4) Check if the revision should be returned by calling
           method :meth:`should_return` and returns it if
           it is the case

    In order to easily instantiate a specific type of revisions
    walker, it is recommended to use the factory function
    :func:`get_revisions_walker`.
