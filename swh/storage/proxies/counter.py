class CountingProxyStorage:
    """Counting Storage Proxy.

    This is in charge of adding objects directly to swh-counters, without
    going through Kafka/swh-journal.
    This is meant as a simple way to setup counters for experiments; production
    should use swh-journal to reduce load/latency of the storage server.

    Additionally, unlike the journal-based counting, it does not count persons
    or the number of origins per netloc.

    Sample configuration use case for filtering storage:

    .. code-block: yaml

        storage:
          cls: counter
          counters:
            cls: remote
            url: http://counters.internal.staging.swh.network:5011/
          storage:
            cls: remote
            url: http://storage.internal.staging.swh.network:5002/
