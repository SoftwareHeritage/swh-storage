Software Heritage - Storage
===========================

Abstraction layer over the archive, allowing to access all stored source code
artifacts as well as their metadata.

## Quick start

### Dependencies

Python tests for this module include tests that cannot be run without a local
Postgresql database, so you need the Postgresql server executable on your
machine (no need to have a running Postgresql server). They also expect a
cassandra server.

#### Debian-like host

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sudo apt install libpq-dev postgresql-11 cassandra


#### Non Debian-like host

The tests expect the path to `cassandra` to either be unspecified, it is then
looked up at `/usr/sbin/cassandra`, either specified through the environment
variable `SWH_CASSANDRA_BIN`.

Optionally, you can avoid running the cassandra tests.

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~/swh-storage$ tox -- -m 'not cassandra'


### Installation

It is strongly recommended to use a virtualenv. In the following, we
consider you work in a virtualenv named `swh`. See the
`developer setup guide <https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/developer-setup.html#developer-setup>`_
for a more details on how to setup a working environment.


You can install the package directly from
`pypi <https://pypi.org/p/swh.storage>`_:

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~$ pip install swh.storage
   [...]


Or from sources:

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~$ git clone https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/swh-storage.git
   [...]
   (swh) :~$ cd swh-storage
   (swh) :~/swh-storage$ pip install .
   [...]


Then you can check it's properly installed:

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~$ swh storage --help
   Usage: swh storage [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

     Software Heritage Storage tools.

   Options:
     -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

   Commands:
     rpc-serve  Software Heritage Storage RPC server.


## Tests

The best way of running Python tests for this module is to use
`tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io>`_.

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~$ pip install tox


### tox

From the sources directory, simply use tox:

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~/swh-storage$ tox
   [...]

     congratulations :)


Note: it is possible to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to specify the
version of the JVM to be used by Cassandra. For example, at the time of writing
this, Cassandra is meant to be run with Java 11. On Debian bookworm, one needs
to manually install openjdk-11-jre-headless from bullseye or unstable and
set the appropriate environment variable:

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~/swh-storage$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
   (swh) :~/swh-storage$ tox
   [...]


## Development

The storage server can be locally started. It requires a configuration file and
a running Postgresql database.

### Sample configuration

A typical configuration `storage.yml` file is:

.. code-block:: yaml

   storage:
     cls: postgresql
     db: "dbname=softwareheritage-dev user=<user> password=<pwd>"
     objstorage:
       cls: pathslicing
       root: /tmp/swh-storage/
       slicing: 0:2/2:4/4:6


which means, this uses:

- a local storage instance whose db connection is to
  `softwareheritage-dev` local instance,

- the objstorage uses a local objstorage instance whose:

  - `root` path is /tmp/swh-storage,

  - slicing scheme is `0:2/2:4/4:6`. This means that the identifier of
    the content (sha1) which will be stored on disk at first level
    with the first 2 hex characters, the second level with the next 2
    hex characters and the third level with the next 2 hex
    characters. And finally the complete hash file holding the raw
    content. For example: 00062f8bd330715c4f819373653d97b3cd34394c
    will be stored at 00/06/2f/00062f8bd330715c4f819373653d97b3cd34394c

Note that the `root` path should exist on disk before starting the server.


### Starting the storage server

If the python package has been properly installed (e.g. in a virtual env), you
should be able to use the command:

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~/swh-storage$ swh storage -C storage.yml rpc-serve


This runs a local swh-storage api at 5002 port.

.. code-block:: shell

   (swh) :~/swh-storage$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5002
   <html>
   <head><title>Software Heritage storage server</title></head>
   <body>
   <p>You have reached the
   <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/">Software Heritage</a>
   storage server.<br />
   See its
   <a href="https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-storage/">documentation
   and API</a> for more information</p>


### And then what?

In your upper layer
(`loader-git <https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/swh-loader-git>`_,
`loader-svn <https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/swh-loader-svn>`_,
etc...), you can define a remote storage with this snippet of yaml
configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

   storage:
     cls: remote
     url: http://localhost:5002/


You could directly define a postgresql storage with the following snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

   storage:
     cls: postgresql
     db: service=swh-dev
     objstorage:
       cls: pathslicing
       root: /home/storage/swh-storage/
       slicing: 0:2/2:4/4:6


## Cassandra

As an alternative to PostgreSQL, swh-storage can use Cassandra as a database
backend. It can be used like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   storage:
     cls: cassandra
     hosts:
       - localhost
     keyspace: swh
     objstorage:
       cls: pathslicing
       root: /home/storage/swh-storage/
       slicing: 0:2/2:4/4:6


The Cassandra swh-storage implementation supports both Cassandra >= 4.0-alpha2
and ScyllaDB >= 4.4 (and possibly earlier versions, but this is untested).

While the main code supports both transparently, running tests
or configuring the schema requires specific code when using ScyllaDB,
enabled by setting the ``SWH_USE_SCYLLADB=1`` environment variable.
