Running database-related tests
==============================

Python tests for this module include tests that cannot be run without a local
Postgres database. You are not obliged to run those tests though:

- `make test`:      will run all tests
- `make test-nodb`: will run only tests that do not need a local DB
- `make test-db`:   will run only tests that do need a local DB

If you do want to run DB-related tests, you should:

- ensure that your user is authorized to create and drop DBs, and in particular
  DBs named "softwareheritage-test" and "softwareheritage-dev"

- ensure that you have the storage testdata repository checked out in
  ../swh-storage-testdata
